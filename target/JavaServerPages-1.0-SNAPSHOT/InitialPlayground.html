    "Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than
    unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not;
    the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent." - Calvin Coolidge
